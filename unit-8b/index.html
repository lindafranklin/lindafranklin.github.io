			<p>"Linda has a great eye for <span>user experience</span> on a website and sees optimizations that others may not have seen. I highly recommend Linda as she is not only willing to help and eager to take on new challenges, but her positive attitude is refreshing as well." <p class="italics">Jen Esarey, colleague</p> <p id="hidden">testtestesttesttesttsettestdfldajfladjfladjflkdasjfkdjfldjfladjfl</p>

		<div class="row">
			<p>"Do I begin with Linda's <span> phenomenal project management skills,</span> her larger than life personality filled with never ending energy (no really, I don't know where it stops, it quite possibly does not), or her ability to ask the right questions and <span>dive into a large set of data pulling the answer out from a mystifying array of numbers and metrics</span>." <p class="italics">David Boyd, colleague</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="row">
			<p>"Linda is a <span>world class operational leader</span>. Her ability to organize and coordinate complex, cross functional activities is exceptional. She is determined, persistent, reliable and willing to push herself to the limit. At the same time, she is polished, professional, cheerful and well liked. Linda takes personal responsibility for team morale in a genuine way that inspires lasting loyalty." <p class="italics">Steve Gaitten, supervisor</p>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<p>"She does an excellent job keeping all task-driven items in front of her at all times and holding team members accountable. This, to me, is her greatest strength. But she also has a <span>deep understanding of digital marketing, website UX, budget tracking/reporting, and data analytics, making her a key player</span> to lead any team in the digital space."  <p class="italics">Alex Gonzalez, colleague</p> <p id="hidden">testtestesttesttesttsettestdfldajfladjfladjflkdasjfkdjfldjfladjfl</p>

				<p class="paragraphs">There is nothing I enjoy more (of course, outside of helping you with your digital marketing challenges!) than enjoying the outdoors with my big, shaggy German shepherd, Sam. We have hiked just about every trail of the Manassas Battlefield, although I believe he would be prefer to stay on the couch! </p>

				<p class="paragraphs">If I&rsquo;m not hiking with Sam, you can find me competing in 5ks, 10ks and the occasional marathon. (Well, OK, I did one marathon, the Marine Corp Marathon. And it was such an amazing experience that I will definitely add another to my list before too long!)</p>

				<p class="paragraphs">I&rsquo;ve been told that I simply can&rsquo;t run for fun.  I always need to have a goal.</p>

				<p class="paragraphs">That is true. It definitely reflects my innate personality of planning and strategizing to meet the end goal. I believe that is why I have excel in the areas of project and web management. I love to create efficient processes, timely plans, and research best practices to create the best end goal possible.</p>

				<p class="paragraphs">Let's discuss your business needs. I am available for contract or full-time assignments.</p>
